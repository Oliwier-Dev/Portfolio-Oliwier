        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 16, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
        <p>These terms set the rules for using this website (the "Site"). By using the Site you agree to these terms. If you hire me for a project, we will agree on a separate written scope and contract for that work.</p>

        <h2>2. Services</h2>
        <p>This Site is a portfolio and information resource. Any service offers, quotes, or project details are subject to a separate agreement that defines scope, timeline, and payment.</p>

        <h2>3. Use of the Site</h2>
        <p>You may use the Site for personal or business reference. You must not misuse the Site, upload harmful content, attempt to access restricted areas, or interfere with its operation.</p>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All content on the Site (design, text, images, code) is owned by me or used with permission. You may not copy, reuse, or redistribute Site content without written permission.</p>

        <h2>5. No Warranty</h2>
        <p>The Site and its content are provided “as is.” I do not guarantee the Site will be error-free, available at all times, or meet all your expectations. Use the Site at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>I am not liable for indirect, special, or consequential damages. My total liability for any claim related to the Site or services is limited to the amount you paid for a specific service, if any.</p>

        <h2>7. External Links</h2>
        <p>The Site links to third-party sites (for example X, GitHub, Instagram). I am not responsible for the content or practices of those sites.</p>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>I may suspend or remove access to the Site or parts of it at any time for any reason. If we have a project contract, termination terms will be in that contract.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>I may update these terms. When changes are made the effective date will be updated. Continued use of the Site means you accept the updated terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by the laws of Sweden to the extent allowed by law.</p>
