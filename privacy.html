        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 16, 2026</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This website is a simple portfolio. I do not collect personal data for marketing or advertising. The only data saved locally is your theme preference (light or dark) so the site remembers your choice.</p>

        <h2>What data we collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect names, emails, or other personal information. The site only stores a small value in your browser (localStorage) to remember whether you chose light or dark mode.</p>

        <h2>How we use data</h2>
        <p>The theme preference is used only to improve your viewing experience. It is never shared, sold, or used for tracking across sites.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and local storage</h2>
        <p>This site does not use tracking cookies or analytics tools. A single local storage entry remembers your theme preference. If you clear your browser data, this preference will be removed.</p>

        <h2>Third-party links</h2>
        <p>The site links to third-party profiles (for example X, GitHub, Instagram). Those sites are separate and have their own privacy policies. I am not responsible for how those sites collect or handle data.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Because the site does not store personal data, there is very little risk. Still, standard best practices are followed for hosting and files. No personal information is stored on this site.</p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>This site is not intended for children under 13. No personal data is knowingly collected from minors.</p>

        <h2>Policy changes</h2>
        <p>I may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with a new effective date.</p>
